I was pretty content with my life, I won't argue that. One night after playing video games I decided to relax before bed, and i saw my first coding video, one from John Sonmez. I was instantly mesmerized, it was so cool, and there was so much out there, and it would always be there and always evolve. Obviously my next step was get into schooland get going. Well that was maybe 6 years ago?

Flash forward to today, i have a daughter and a wife, and yep still working as a mechanic. what happened? I made excuses in school, i couldn't do it, there was too much, etc. A few months ago, i found out, lots of solid devs felt the same too, they couldn't do the school, so they taught themselves, i even found some who went to a bootcamp named FlatIron. I am enrolled now, and i couldn't be happier. It wasn't that I couldn't do it. I even reached out to locals devs to chat and reassured me that just becasue I wasn't strong in a traditional school didn't mean i couldn't be a dev. I went a reseached everywhere and I kept seeing two things pop up. "Am i too old to start learning code?" and Whats the easiest way to learn BLANK language?" 

It's not about age. it's not about where you went to school, or what your background is, its about your passion. If you want to do something, grind it out and just go do it. That was basically what all these pros said, just get after it. so I did. I looked into languages and started with Java. It is a strong OOP language and stands against time that it will not be going anywhere. I went on teamtreehouse.com and udemy.com and udacity.com. Now. maybe i went over board, but i knew already that styling and experience matter, so i decided three teachers are better than one. I just kept at it everyday and then looked for schools.

I was really hesitant about starting another style school, but all these videos Avi, and the community posted, and seeing what they were willing to do for students astounded me. The open chat for help, the quick emails, the structure of course, and explanation on why they picked the things they did. Avi, and FlatIron, and also Ruby, made me fall in love with code all over again, and I firmly beleive i cant be very successful with the guideance I now have.

It's very corny, and cliche, but find a code for yourself or a rule, mine came from a childrens movie named, Meet The Robinsons, the father in the movie has a saying "Just keep moving forward" its helped me chase down becoming a dev every step of the way.
