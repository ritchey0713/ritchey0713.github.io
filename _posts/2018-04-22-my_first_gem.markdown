  Here we were, after a few weeks, I had what felt like my first real world problem. There were no tests, no guidelines, it was a chance to showcase what we've learned so far, and my first chance to show my individuality as a programmer.  It also felt like the first plunge. I was staring at an empty screen, with nothing to think, or do. 

  I've been in the work field for a while, and this felt like work, but then, I’ve always had at least some kind of halfcocked plan. always. I did have a small beacon of hope though. After reading through what was expected in this project, Avi, left us a video, on a basic layout of how to approach this problem. It was then I realized, my blank application was nothing to be afraid of. 
	
	 Now that I had a place to begin, I thought about what to build. I am a very avid Rpg player, so I thought it would cool to build something based on that. Most of what I thought about was way too much info and not very much interaction. So that’s how I came up with a simple top three list. Where I could also call to something else and iterate for my listing.  It would have a small amount of info, and then I could build a small drop menu to have extra info, what better place to have a short story summary. Then I had to decide how I wanted to interact with the user, setting up a puts to ask for info was a good place to start but then I decided the easiest to deal with would be an if/ else statement. I'm still not sure if that was the best route, but I made the decision that I was going to build that. I now had everything all laid out, and all that was left was to build methods for scraping... 
	 
	 This was horrible. I started this with a very simple understanding on how to scrape, but not exactly what scraping was or how flexible it was, or what was the best, or simplest way to go about it. Now I am confident with scraping, and that’s awesome. I searched a lot and did a lot of reading, and even build some new relationships with people over the course of this. First, I had to pull the name of the games, but I also decided I wanted to implement a release date and the developer on my initial lines. The names were easy. listed outside with their own self named class, just like the scraping lesson. Awesome. Then I found everything else I was looking for was listed under simple paragraph tags. I looked everywhere sent snippets, and came up with zero, even worse, it confused me about the things I thought I knew about scraping. Then I found some obscure comment on a blog I read, they simply said "When you call for the first tag, it should pull everything into an array..." Well, that’s worth a shot! 
	 
	 I ran back into my pry as quick as I could and called for a doc. search under the p tag and called a random array element. Of course, it wasn't what I was looking for, but it was in the code where I was looking! Then I did some digging and got everything extracted. Now, I’m sure better minds than me have a much better way to get to those. I'm even hoping to come back later after I’ve learned more and build it even simpler and more eloquent. I threw it all together, fixed some indents, and ran it. it worked, and this has been one of my proudest accomplishments now.
