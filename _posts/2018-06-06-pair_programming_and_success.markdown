Today I’d like to talk about my future aspirations, I started here at FlatIron because I found a strong interest in developing, and as my adventure with everyone here has unfolded I’ve also really grown to love pair programming. I found it to be a very strong way to accomplish goals and apps quickly and it is effective on all levels. I’ve begun to also try to help the teaching staff by doing some pair programming with some students who are struggling with things I can help with. I started my own helpful slack channel for anyone to reach out about coding, or even other life problems in general. You gain a sense of pride from helping your peers learn something. Everyone picks up different things quicker than others, and I thought this was a great way for us to reinforce our learnings, keep up pace with each other and have a group of people to talk to, find docs with, and grow together, and in the future, for those who are willing, build our own open source project or web app!

 	I did a quick interview with a peer about her experiences with me and our pair programming sessions. Her name is Joanne Lee, she is a strong student with a bright future I’ve had the pleasure of working with several time. Our post pairing went as follows: 

Me: What have I done to make it easy to approach pairing with? 

Jo: You have a super down to earth personality, very extroverted! Always taking initiative to strike up a scintillating conversation! 

Me: What could I work on to help you more? 

Jo: nothing!

Me: What quality while pairing do you appreciate the most?

Jo: 3. how you put people at ease! Most importantly, I don't feel judged at all! You give off a vibe of 'we're in this together’! 

Me: Have I misinformed you or been unable to help in any way? 

Jo: Nope, never!

Me: Why would you want to suggest others to come to me for help? 

Jo: Super nice, super friendly, super helpful. 

Me: What was your overall experience working with me through pairing?

Jo: Pretty much looking forward to bouncing more coding ideas and concepts with you! Thanks for being so accessible and personable!

	As I continue to learn and grow into a better stronger developer I’d like to raise up my peers with me and hopefully learn from them as much as I try to help them learn. If possible I’d like to continue showing everyone how powerful a tool pair programming is, and with the experience we all gain from it at school, transitioning into work with a team who uses it will be gladly welcomed, hopefully!
