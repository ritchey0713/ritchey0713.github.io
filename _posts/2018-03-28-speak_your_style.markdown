When you finally breakthrough into the web developer world, the one constant is HTML, and CSS. They are as entwined together as much as peanut butter and jelly. CSS even being down talked as a "mark-up language" carries some real weight, in our current world, so many places are the same save their style, so being strong is CSS is a must. It could be the only thing that really sets you apart with some good flair. 

So, how do you implement CSS? As I’ve stressed, CSS coding goes into a <style> line or lines. Depending on what you mean to accomplish you can code right into your html file, or you can build a sperate file for all the CSS and then run a link. 

As an example, <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">

This is called a external style sheet, this I would say is the best route, and most suggested. Now, getting into the meat and potatoes of CSS, what can you accomplish with CSS? adding colors or graphics into a background, changing fonts and colors, all these things are things that CSS controls. 

The thing one might find the largest struggle with is browser compatibility, when you watch tutorials, or even talk to most devs, or ask stackoverflow for a quick fix or an answer, it us usually assumed you are using chrome. The problem is, not everyone does. It isn't terrible, but you must always remember to cross check against things like edge, or even internet explorer. (Yes, some people still use that). For the most part anything you want to accomplish with CSS is easy if you don't mind reading, and like anything with any style it takes some experimenting to getting something solid looking. The last tip I’ll leave you with is, always remember there can be too much of a good thing, some moderation is always a good trait as well.
