After a few days of trying to brainstorm on what to build my project on and getting no where, I went for a ride on my bike. Then it hit me, to write a app, storing what bike I rode, and where it was I was going, and how far it was, I could track every where i went, and I could find out how far I had traveled this riding season! AWESOME!

OH WAIT...It sounded simple enough, but I've struggled, a lot. Some things weren't so bad, I, of course had some syntax errors, because who doesn't but then I found REAL issues, things I hadn't really found as an issue in the labs or in these video walkthroughs. I had some ActiveRecord struggles. I was finding out that even when logging in as several users, all the info was posted, and you were able to edit anything. NOT GOOD.  I did everything i'Ve learned about with debgging so far, dropping prys, running tux, changing routes just to see where I was being sent to, but thats whats been stumping me. Everything is working properly, other than I cannot assign a foreign key, and everything is able to be edited as long as you are signed in, which is not what we want to happen ever.

Hopefully with my 1 on 1 tomorrow we will isolate what I've done wrong, and with this struggle i'll remember for the future and be better.
