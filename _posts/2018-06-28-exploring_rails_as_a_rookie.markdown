Finally, here we are, getting to build with rails. I've learned Ruby is just Ruby, Rails brings a lot to the table, it is the pinnacle to myself, but there is NO magic. It's all just a gem, which is nice, you could built it all yourself, or just add Rails and pick out the things you need to use. After learning how it works and how the parts move, it didn't seem so bad but until I built this project, I had no idea how much would stick or how well i'd remember how to do things. 

Looking back to my first real project, which was building a CLI gem, I have come a far way. Things like iterating over an array or hash made me nervous, or that I just didn't quite understand, and now sitting here I've built a full dynamic webpage, I did have some help along the way with some misconceptions I had, but alas here we are! 

It was important to me to build something I am fond of, and after some debate, I came up with my ranking site. I'm avid about ranks in game and I thought it would be cool to build a site to track it for me. I may have been able to come up with a better join model than rank but it seemed to fit with my idea, of a game and a ranking. I envisioned logging in seeing all the games i play ranked in, and then being able to click them and see all my detailed info, and also having an edit, if I change a rank, or if I make changes to who I play as.

I have found some things out about myself as a developer that I need to work on, some are negative, and some not. I haven’t given myself enough credit for trusting myself and how I think logic should work, and to tinker if it isn’t quite right at first. One negative I have found is I brushed some things off that didn’t seem important at the time because I didn’t use it right away and ended up having to go back, which now that I can see I can correct in the future. 

The largest struggle i had was slimming everything down, I had a few dead resources, and I built this using my games and users, and trying to let Rails deal with my join table in the background. I was mostly successful, only a few times did I have to forcefully deal with my join table my self, which made things much easier to stub out and relay my logic to the site. Overall, I found I know more, and I'm learning more than i had thought. It was such a good feeling to look over everything I've learned, and struggled with, and to see all my hardships come to fruition. I plan to build out several more Rails sites on my own time, with different logic flows and taking advantage of some other complex gems such as Devise, Happy coding!
