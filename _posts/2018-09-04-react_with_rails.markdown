This is my final project, and I tried to steer clear of things I have already done. I found great difficulty in trying to do something that would showcase all the skills we've learned, but not snowball into something too large. I started several projects, the issue I kept finding myself in was they felt like a reskinned to-do app. As we all know every time someone makes a to-do app, a puppy dies.
​
I created a photo app, that would allow users to get real time feedback, and with an anonymous post, people could give you honest feedback. The API was simple enough, we will have a new, create and, delete actions a single posting controller, and a DB for saving the comments, posts, likes, and supporting info. Building my own API helped me get a feel for what a API is on the simplest level. I have become much more comfortable with them through this project, and as I used RoR it made it even easier as I felt at home with it. 
​
React is scary, starting this project out, I hit a lot of snags, and at the beginning it was frustrating. Coming out of this, I LOVE REACT. The structure, the design, how it looks, and reads to a developer, it really is powerful and amazing. Debugging is weird to get used to at first but after playing with it, and learning how to use the dev tools properly, it is a wonder. A gem if you will. Okay, no more puns I swear. The biggest struggle I really had at the beginning was trying to make things a class or const. I found its much better for me to start with all components as a class and come back to make it a const if a class isn’t needed. 
​
Redux, also something I understood on a  conceptional, but was not sure of my skills because of how little i used to up until this project. Passing things around with React is simple enough but is not ideal for a scalable project. With Redux, you have one state, and everything passes as props, which makes things so easy, with more than just a few components, it gets hard to tell what each component has as props or state, or even what to expect it to have, theres a lot of debugging and logging you have to do, and on top of that with redux, we get actions, and reducers, which wire up to the single state, and fetch from the API you get the info from, and did I mention, the state is available everywhere? The setup is a little time consuming, and there is a few rules you have to follow, but once you get the hang of it, you'll save so many hours. 
​
All in all, I have to say this is my most profitable project, in all the other ones i knew exactly what i was doing, and how to do it, with this one, it was more "real world". I was enthused at first but it gave me quite a bit of confidence moving forward, that i can do this. I felt a lot of imposter syndrome, but looking at the code, and my app, I feel very successful, understanding now, what the program, and Avi gave me. This has been an amazing adventure. I am excited to see what the future holds, Thank you all.
